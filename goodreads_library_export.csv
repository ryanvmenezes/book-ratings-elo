After finishing, I’m thankful for the incredible efforts Katherine Boo took to explain this small part of the world. She covers thoroughly the persistent strife that comes with living in such poverty while narrating dramatic tales of how the slum came to be, why the slum dwellers were always at odds and what they did to survive. It’s a story informed by anthropology and virtually no topic is uncovered: religion, politics, economics, the criminal justice system and more.<br/><br/>My earlier concerns were assuaged after reading her author’s note detailing her reporting process at the end of the book. Plus, as an Indian, I appreciated the way she wove in particular turns of phrase and certain non-verbal cues that showed to me she understood the communication between the people she covered, despite not knowing the languages herself.<br/><br/>This particular slum comes right up to the perimeter of the airport in Bombay and I was always curious about it on childhood visits. I’m glad I finally got to learn more about it.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
